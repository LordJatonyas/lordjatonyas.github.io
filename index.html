    <div class="text">
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m John Lee.</p>
    <p>Founder of <a href="https://aimo-labs.com">Sentineu</a>, delivering sentiment analysis as a service.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from my integrated Master's in Engineering Science at Oxford. My final year thesis, or 4th year project (4YP), was supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/natalia-ares/">Natalia Ares</a>, and was about using Reinforcement Learning to design quantum chips.
        I spent my 3rd year project (3YP) designing an ACL rehab knee brace with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-cherian-a6439b113/">Ryan Cherian</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoonsang-lee-ysl020620/">Yoonsang Lee</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-taylor-5baaba23a/">Will Taylor</a>. We were co-supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/mauricio-villarroel/">Mauricio Villaroel</a> and <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/liang-he/">Liang He</a>.</p>
    <p>During college, I completed several internships: 2 in industry working with Machine Learning and 1 in neuroscience research at UCL in the <a href="http://www.dendrites.org">Hausser Lab</a> mentored by <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/90301-alex-prodan">Alex Prodan</a>.
        I had also worked as President of Oxford's neurotech society <a href="https://www.oxfordsu.org/get-involved/clubs-and-societies/join/oxneurotech/">OxNeurotech</a> between Jan 2024 and Mar 2025, and the Human-Robot Interaction
        sub-team lead at <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/student-teams/team-orion/">Team ORIon</a> between Oct 2022 and Jul 2023.</p>
    <p>Before college, I completed 2 years of conscription in the Singapore Armed Forces, serving mostly in the Navy.</p>
