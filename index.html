    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m John Lee.</p>
    <p>Co-founder and Lead Engineer of <a href="https://aimo-labs.com">AiMo Labs</a>.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from my integrated Master's in Engineering Science at Oxford where I was a 4th year project (4YP) student in the Quantum Device Lab supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/natalia-ares/">Natalia Ares</a>.</p>
    <p>My 3rd year project (3YP) in wearable technology was co-supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/mauricio-villarroel/">Mauricio Villaroel</a> and <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/liang-he/">Liang He</a>.</p>
    <p>Before college, I completed 2 years of mandatory conscription in the Singapore Armed Forces, serving primarily in the Navy.</p>
