    <div class="text">
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m John Lee.</p>
    <p>This website acts like a central spoke-hub for my digital footprint, a place to re-orient visitors looking to learn more about me.</p>
    <p>Let me introduce myself:</p>
    <p>I recently graduated from my integrated Master's in Engineering Science at Oxford. My final year thesis, or 4th year project (4YP), was supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/natalia-ares/">Natalia Ares</a>, and was about using Reinforcement Learning to design quantum chips.
        I spent my 3rd year project (3YP) designing an ACL rehab knee brace with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-cherian-a6439b113/">Ryan Cherian</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoonsang-lee-ysl020620/">Yoonsang Lee</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-taylor-5baaba23a/">Will Taylor</a>. We were co-supervised by <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/mauricio-villarroel/">Mauricio Villaroel</a> and <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/liang-he/">Liang He</a>.</p>
    <p>During college, I completed several internships: 2 in industry working touching BI and ML, and 2 in the neurotech space, one in non-invasive BCIs and the other at UCL in the <a href="http://www.dendrites.org">Hausser Lab</a> mentored by <a href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/90301-alex-prodan">Alex Prodan</a> where I focused more on foundational neuroscience.
        I had also worked as President of Oxford's neurotech society <a href="https://www.oxfordsu.org/get-involved/clubs-and-societies/join/oxneurotech/">OxNeurotech</a> between Jan 2024 and Mar 2025, and the Human-Robot Interaction
        sub-team lead at <a href="https://ori.ox.ac.uk/student-teams/team-orion/">Team ORIon</a> between Sep 2022 and Jul 2023.</p>
    <p>Before college, I completed 2 years of conscription in the Singapore Armed Forces, serving mostly in the Navy. There, I worked in the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre, dealing with threat assessment based on a multitude of maritime-related information sources.</p>
    <p>I'm a sports lover, playing 11-a-side football, 5-a-side futsal, and British-style pool at college level.
        I find the execution and strategy of plays in these sports extremely rewarding on both the physical and mental fronts.</p>
